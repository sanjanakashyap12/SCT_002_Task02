# Stopwatch App

The **Stopwatch App** is a simple and intuitive web-based stopwatch built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to measure elapsed time with precision in hours, minutes, and seconds. 

## Features
- Start, stop, and reset functionality.
- Real-time digital timer display.
- Clean and visually appealing interface with hover effects on buttons.
- Fully responsive and works in all modern browsers.

## How It Works
The stopwatch uses JavaScript's `setInterval` function to increment seconds, minutes, and hours dynamically. When the timer reaches 60 seconds, it increments the minutes, and similarly, 60 minutes increment the hours. The timer display updates in real-time to show the current elapsed time in `HH:MM:SS` format.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click **Start** to begin the timer.
3. Click **Stop** to pause the timer.
4. Click **Reset** to reset the timer to `00:00:00`.
